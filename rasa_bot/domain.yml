  - text: "Blockchain is a decentralized technology that stores and verifies transactions across a network of computers. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together and secured using cryptography, making it highly secure and resistant to tampering. Blockchain operates without a central authority, providing transparency, immutability, and trust in the recording of digital transactions."
